A detailed evaluation of the selection sort algorithm's accuracy can be obtained by analyzing it's detailed operations.  The least element from the unsorted part is chosen, and each time the algorithm runs, it is always placed at the beginning of the array. The algorithm's focus to maintaining the fact that the elements before the current position are sorted is essential to determining whether the sorting procedure is valid. It is essential to ensure the correctness of the sorting process. The algorithm continuously builds a sorted prefix for the array by carefully determining the minimum element and replacing it with the first unsorted element in every iteration. As a result, the selection sort makes sure that each phase of its process results in an array that is properly sorted.
